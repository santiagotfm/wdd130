              The founder of this company was lent some money to buy a sewing
              machine, it was sold to him by a man who had a stall in the market
              of the Neighborhood. With the sewing machine, he began to make
              increasingly elaborate straps himself, with stitching on the
              sides, as well as shoes and belts.
