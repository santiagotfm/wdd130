      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The idea for my website idea is creating a website to sell clothes online. Customers can see different
articles that they would like to buy, they can select the size and color and make purchases. I think this is
a very good idea to practice the principles that have been taught during the class and make something
useful like this. The website would include pictures of the clothes and a description and the price of the
product.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The main target audience for my website are people interested in buying clothes online. In this case, since the clothes style that will be shown on the website is casual wear, which is more appealing to young people around ages 14-30. There is also another group that may be an audience as well, because a lot of times young people, especially teenagers depend financially of their parents. They are also the target because they could visit the website too. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/031926-468189-77aca2-9dbebb-f4e9cd" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/031926-468189-77aca2-9dbebb-f4e9cd</a>
